### Corkboard
- [x] Project Setup
  - Start the project, change filestructure, and 
  develop app foundation such as configure Vite, 
  migrate to React, and create auxiliary modules 
  for the Rust backend.
  - Implement routers via React Router.

- [x] Implement frontend styler.

  - [x] Convert template page styling from CSS into to TS using the 
  styler. 

- [x] Implement backend Download module.
  - Write module that allows downloading from a source, returning a Download / Result object. Expecting good coding habits in this one.
  
- [ ] Implement library page. 
  - Thinking of a more floaty design compared to Suwariyomi's rough, rigid,
  and serious design.

- [ ] Return to backend, implement database support for Manga. 

- [ ] Implement CBZ file import handshake for frontend and backend.
  - This file import structure should also be able to support `.zip` files (::from_zip, ::from_cbz).

- [ ] Implement source import page with local manga at the bottom.
